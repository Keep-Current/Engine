## Meetups

We welcome anyone who would like to join and contribute. We meet regularly every month in Vienna through the Data Science Cafe meetup of the VDSG, show our progress and discuss the next steps. Please follow [our meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/Vienna-Data-Science-Group-Meetup/) to get updates regarding our next meeting.

## Machine Learning & Natural Language Processing

This repository is dedicated to machine-learning based engine. Among the items we handle here are document classifications, semantic representations of documents,  topics distance mapping, adaptation according to user's feedback, etc.

If you're new to Machine Learning, we suggest starting by reading the following sources:

* [Machine learning collection](https://github.com/collections/machine-learning)
* [Natural Language Processing in Python Book](http://nltk.org/book/)
* [Keon's awesome-nlp!](https://github.com/keon/awesome-nlp)

### Recommended tools:

We lean heavily on existing tools as well as developing our own new methods. We are colaborating through Google Colab notebooks. Among the existing tools we are using: 

* [TextBlob](http://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/)
* [spaCy](https://spacy.io/)

### Vision & Roadmap

We want to use this goal also as a reason to have a playground to implement, test, hack and compare different models.

Currently, we're working on:

* Collecting data to create a 'gold-truth' dataset, to be able to compare different models on.
* Developing unsupervised models for document clustering

## I have different skills

If you wish to assist in different aspects, such as Data Engineering, Web development, DevOps, we have divided the project to several additional repositories focusing on these topics.
