We welcome anyone who would like to join and contribute.

We meet regularly every month in Vienna through

- the [Data Science Cafe meetup of the VDSG](https://www.meetup.com/Vienna-Data-Science-Group-Meetup/) or
- the [WeAreDevelopers :: Keep-Current meetup](https://www.meetup.com/WeAreDevelopers/)

to show our progress and discuss the next steps.

### Project Architecture

We follow the [clean architecture style](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) and structure the codebase accordingly.

Most important rule:

> Source code dependencies can only point inwards. Nothing in an inner circle can know anything at all about something in an outer circle. In particular, the name of something declared in an outer circle must not be mentioned by the code in the an inner circle. That includes, functions, classes. variables, or any other named software entity.

### Git workflow

Currently we use an adapted version of [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow). We are currently not using the develop branch as the project structure does not require it. Everything else is the same.

### Issues / Pull Request

We have created templates for issues and pull requests to ensure a coherent workflow.

As a general rule, always make sure that:

- you are formatting your code according to the black formatter
- you are linting your code with pylint and our pylint settings
- all tests pass

We have several integration tools hooked up for reviewing pull requests. Make sure that those tests are also passing, and if not provide a detailled explanation why not and why it is not necessary to comply.
